					      <h3>Match Data Endpoint</h3>
					      <p> The Match Data endpoint on the RIOT API is by far the most complicated request. As such, although it is related less to querying the API, taking some time to sort through this response will help us better understand how to work with responses from all of the endpoints on the Riot API.</p>
					    </section>
					  </div>
					  <div class="8u skel-cell-important">

					      <h2>Retrieving Match Data</h2>
								<iframe width="100%" height="600" src="//jsfiddle.net/akshaysu/mfshtv2g/embedded/js/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
					      <p> Let's start with our request basics. The general syntax for retrieving the data from a match is: /api/lol/{region}/v2.2/match/{matchId}. If you notice within the URL inside the GET request we have embedded the matchID that we extracted from our previous request. Often when we use the Riot API we will need to use a piece of information from one request as a query parameter in a different request. We'll touch more on this in a little bit. </p>
					    </section>

					<div class="row">
					  <div class="4u">
					    <section>
					      <h3>Finding your Match Data</h3>
					      <p>Unfortunately, the Riot API does not allow you to filter out your specific information when making a Match Data Request. As such we need to navigate through and find the playerId associated with all of your data. </p>
					    </section>
					  </div>
					  <div class="8u skel-cell-important">
					    <section>
					      <a href="#" ><img src="images/findplayer.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					      <p> All information about the players in match is stored in the participant identities object. Included within this is an attribute called players which is an array objects with each object containing information about each player. Here we cycle through this array of objects looking for summoner Name in each attribute. When we find this, we can store the corresponding player Id for later use. </p>
					    </section>

					<div class="row">
					  <div class="4u">
					    <section>
					      <h3>Timeline Data</h3>
					      <p>The timeline is how Riot keeps track of the what events occurred at what times. The time is represented in milliseconds. Every minute, all of the events and changed statistics are listed. </p>
					    </section>
					  </div>
					  <div class="8u skel-cell-important">
					    <section>
					      <a href="#" ><img src="images/timelineinfo.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					      <p> Timeline information is stored according to an object called frames. The number of frames within a game varies dependent on the length. However, a frame is stored every minute. There is an <strong> extraordinary </strong> amount of data stored within frames including every event that took place on the map for that minute (ward placed, champion killed etc.). Here we can see that we've used our playerId to grab our specific minions killed (creep score) for each frame. </p>

								<h3>Callbacks</h3>
								<p> We call the functon that we pass to the addListenerEvent a callback. We've seen from the above code that inside the callback we can work with the data we request. Doing this inside the callback is essential. </p>
					    </section>
					  </div>
					  <div class="8u skel-cell-important">
					    <section>
					      <h2>Where is Our Code Located?</h2>
								<p> There is one absolutely essential last piece of information to glean from this code snippet. Notice how <strong> all </strong> of our work with the response is being done <strong> within </strong> the callback? This is because any code that comes after (and outside) the callback can actually be executed before the callback finishes. This is what makes our calls asynchronous. We can actually go ahead and start doing other stuff while our callback function waits for our information to 'load' so it can work with it.</p>
								<p> This may seem a little confusing. So let's move forward and look at an example that may better illustrate this. </p>
