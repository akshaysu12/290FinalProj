Learning To Use the Riot Games API -  A How to Guide for CS 290

This site hosted at https://akshaysu12.github.io/290FinalProj/ was built to teach people interested in learning how to 
interact with an API and make AJAX requests. The site uses an interactive example with the Riot Games API to teach the 
fundamentals of APIs, making GET requests and implementing asynchronous control flow. The examples build up to a demonstration
of how to use the Riot Games API to make a small tool that visualizes a user's data into a table.
